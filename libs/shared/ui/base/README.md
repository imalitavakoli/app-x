# shared-ui-base

A simple base CSS rules that almost all of the apps should have them.  
Apps must import these styles in their global styles.

**Note!** It's recommended to import this lib as the last import of styles in your app! Because global styles and some overriding styles here in this lib MUST be applied across the whole app and they should not overridden.
