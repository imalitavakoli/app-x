# shared-ui-framework8

Framework8 contains blocks of CSS & JS for those who love good design.  
A non-technology related lib that contains `.scss` and `.js` files. It has blocks (or let me say components, elements, plugins, or whatever you say) such as 'dropdown', 'light/dark switch', and some 'utility' styles and functions.
