# shared-feature-ng-translations

This is the translations lib which lists the user's available languages, and defines her already selected language. Then lets the user to change her language, which leads to the app's language change eventually.

It uses its related _data-access_ lib to call its actions and update its state object.  
It uses its related _ui_ lib to provide the updated state object properties as the lib's input values.

By initializing this lib, we will have a real-world working translations UI which also deals with API. Cheers 🍺
