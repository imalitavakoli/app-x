# shared-feature-ng-x-users

This lib is the last piece of the puzzle for the functionality to get fully implemented.

- It initializes the required '_data-access_' lib(s) to call their actions and update their state object.
- It initializes the required '_ui_' lib(s) to provide the updated state object properties as input values for the lib(s).

By initializing this lib in a '_page_', we will have a real-world working UI which also deals with API for our functionality. Cheers 🍺

**For what functionality this lib is for?**
ng-x-users.
