# shared-data-access-ng-translations

Holds Angular apps' translations NgRx state.  
In simple terms, these are one of our app's feature states. What feature state? `translations` state!
Apps need to show some texts here and there, and we need to know in what language those texts should be shown.

With the help of translations (NgRx related state management codes for controlling this state of the app), our app can understand in what language it should show different texts across the app.
