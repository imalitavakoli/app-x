# shared-data-access-ng-auth

Holds Angular apps' auth NgRx state.  
In simple terms, these are one of our app's feature states. What feature state? `auth` state!
Apps can login users via a service that is called Magic Link.

With the help of auth (NgRx related state management codes for controlling this state of the app), users can login to the app.
