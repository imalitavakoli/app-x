# shared-data-access-ng-x-credit

Holds Angular apps' XCredit NgRx state.  
In simple terms, these are one of our app's feature states. What feature state? `XCredit` state!
Most of our apps need to deal with the XCredit API to show the energy XCredit of the logged in user's locations.

With the help of XCredit (NgRx related state management codes for controlling this state of the app), users can see their energy XCredit visually.
