# NX Console extension ðŸ”®

It might be hard to remember all of the commands that are useful for our development, right? Specially when we install more libraries and add more schematics to our workspace... So what's the solution? To install [NX Console VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.ng-console) and take advantage of it! This extension also helps you see the workspace graph and libraries relationships visually.

**Tip!** In order to run some commonly used commands, you can also take a look at '**[Guidelines > 3](../guidelines/available-commands.md)**' ('Available commands') section of the docs, and just simply use the copy-paste ready-to-use sample commands there to immediately generate libs or other stuff, instead of using this extension and wondering what parameters you should pass to generate a specific lib type (or something like that)!
